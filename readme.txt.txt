Project Description : 
---------------------
Cloud Computing has drastically changed oneâ€™s approach towards the way of accessing data and processing power. It has brought a disruptive view for providing on demand information access and applications from anywhere at any time. Features of Cloud Computing include:  Scalability, Resource Pooling, Easy Network Access, Availability, Easy Maintenance, Automation and Security. It is because of these features both the hosts and clients who are responsible for operations and management of their applications are viewing Cloud Computing as their ultimate resource. It is also very easy to use which alone makes its reach to the end users much more domineering than the available technologies.
Due to the current pandemic situation, there has been many discrepancies and delays in the information about the COVID symptoms that is being relayed to the masses. It is still not clear to the people what are the symptoms that they should be worried about, the extent up to which it affects the person and spread in the surroundings and where should they go to treat their symptoms.
It is these high reach, availability, and scalability features and services of Cloud Computing that we are leveraging upon to build and host the current web application which helps the common people to assess their symptoms and get to know the test centres and its details that are available in their location to treat the affected.
